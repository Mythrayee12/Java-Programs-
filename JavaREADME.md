# ðŸš€ Java Control Flow & Arrays - Basics & Implementations  

Welcome to the **Java Control Flow & Arrays Repository**! ðŸŽ¯ This collection contains essential Java programs covering **decision-making, looping constructs, and array operations** to help you strengthen your Java fundamentals.  

## ðŸ“Œ Contents  
This repository includes:  
âœ… **Control Flow Statements**  
   - Conditional Statements (`if`, `if-else`, `switch-case`)  
   - Looping Constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
   - Break & Continue Statements  
   - Nested Loops & Pattern Programs  

âœ… **Array Operations & Manipulations**  
   - Initializing & Printing Arrays  
   - Basic Operations (Insert, Delete, Update, Search)  
   - Sorting & Searching Algorithms  
   - Multi-Dimensional Arrays (Matrix Operations)  
   - Advanced Problems (Merging, Rotating, Duplicates)
### ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts of Methods:

- **Method Declaration**: Defines what the method does and what inputs it takes.
- **Method Invocation**: Calling the method to perform its task.
- **Return Types**: Specifies what type of value (if any) a method returns.
- **Parameters**: Values passed to the method for processing.
- **Method Overloading**: Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
- **Recursion**: When a method calls itself to solve a problem.
